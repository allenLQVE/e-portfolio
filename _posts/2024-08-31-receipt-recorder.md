This application allowed users to record the merchandise they bought from different grocery stores. It can be used to compare the prices between the stores or to see the frequency of purchasing specific items.

This project uses Python with the Django rest framework to construct a RESTful API. As the structure of the project is very straightforward, the database uses a lightweight SQLite3 database that is contained in Django. It contains records that represent the purchase of different merchandise in different grocery stores, items that represent the merchandise, and stores that represent different grocery stores.

The UI is in the [receiptrecorder_frontend](https://github.com/allenLQVE/receiptrecorder_frontend) which was built up with React.
