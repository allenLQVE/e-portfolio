<hr/>

This application allowed users to record the merchandise they bought from grocery stores. It can be used to compare the prices between the stores or to see the frequency of purchasing specific items.

This is the front end of the [Receipt Recorder](https://github.com/allenLQVE/ReceiptRecorder). This project uses React with Boostrap. It connects to the back end with API calls with the Axios package.
